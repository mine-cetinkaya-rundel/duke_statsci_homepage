The focus of this Summit is the introductory statistics courses offered by the Department of Statistical Science. Through an interactive discussion, we share how we teach introductory statistics conceptually and using real data from many disciplines and applications. We also hope to hear your thoughts on how best to prepare students for future classes in other disciplines. This event has an open invitation to all Duke community, but DUSs and advisors are particularly invited to participate. <br>

We held a similar event in 2012, but since then we have revised and tweaked many of our introductory classes. A summary of the highlights from this event can be found <a href="ses/ses-highlights-2012.pdf">here</a>. We would like to hear from you about how the courses have been serving students you work with. <br>

<br>

*Agenda:*

- Why should every student be exposed to reasoning with data and statistical thinking?
- A brief overview of our introductory statistics courses and other courses of interest to non-stats majors
<!-- - Hear what students have to say -->
- Discussion: 
  - What concepts, tools, and types of data would you like to see more of in our introductory courses?
  - How are our introductory courses serving your curriculum's / students' learning goals?
